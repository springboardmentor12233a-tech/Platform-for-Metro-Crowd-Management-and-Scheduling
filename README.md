# MetroFlow AI: Intelligent Crowd Management & Scheduling Platform

MetroFlow AI is a state-of-the-art Metro Crowd Management and Scheduling Command Center. It integrates scikit-learn machine learning regression/classification models (HistGradientBoosting) and a grounded LLM (xAI Grok Copilot) to predict crowd density, forecast demand, optimize transit frequencies, alert operators of congestion, and allow natural language analysis of station telemetry.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **User Identity & RBAC (MongoDB)**
   - Role-Based Access Control enforcing permission limits on three tiers: `admin` (System Administrator), `manager` (Traffic Manager), and `user` (Passenger Observer).
   - Auto-provisioning of demo operator credentials on first signin for seamless evaluation.
   
2. **Real-time Telemetry & GIS (PostgreSQL & Leaflet)**
   - Tracks 285 stations, 14 transit lines, 56 trains, and thousands of schedules.
   - Beautiful dark-themed **AI Smart City Metro Operations Command Center** dashboard with live telemetry indicators (delays, active alerts, total ridership counts).
   - Live Leaflet-based Geographic Heatmap highlighting station crowd densities.

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline (scikit-learn Models A, B, C, D)**
   - **Model A (Crowd Count Regressor)**: Predicting segment passenger count. Shrunk model pickle file size from 4.3 GB to **552 KB** with MAE = 100.06 and R² = 0.9790.
   - **Model B (Passenger Demand Forecaster)**: Sequentially projects station passenger counts for the next 3 hours using lag-shift features. R² = 0.8826.
   - **Model C (Congestion Status Classifier)**: Predicts threshold overcrowding status. Accuracy = 94.66%, F1 = 0.9634.
   - **Model D (Scheduling Optimizer)**: Rule-based headway, frequency, and train allocation calculations.
   
4. **AI Metro Copilot (xAI Grok Grounding)**
   - Grounded LLM Chat Assistant utilizing live database telemetry (active alerts, congested stations, delayed train numbers) to ground its responses, falling back to simulated templates if keys are unconfigured.
